## The EFBO Functional Reasoning Category (EFBO-FRC) Ontology
The EFBO-Functional Reasoning Category (EFBO-FRC) includes the classes associated with different functional reasoning categories under the Entity Classifier Class of the core EFBO. The EFBO-FRC is an importable module for the EFBO core ontology and includes logical axioms to define its reasoning categories based on different EFBO core classes and properties. It should be noted that the EFBO-FRC does not contain any new properties for itself and simply reuses the properties from the EFBO core.

Closely based on the general reasoning categories in event calculus such as deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning, we have included several functional reasoning categories for the systems that are modeled based on the EFBO representation. These categories are defined within this utility ontology called EFBO-FRC.
